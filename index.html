								<h2 class="major">Who Am I? </h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/michael-flute.jpg" alt="me playing flute" /></span>
								<p> Hey guys I’m Michael Scaringi, I was born and raised in Melbourne. Completed secondary school then moved to Ballarat with my family, but quickly found out the gold rush ended 160 years ago, so I moved back down to Melbourne in a share house with a couple of friends. I have a strong Italian background, can partially speak Italian and I can make a pasta sauce that mia mamma can be proud of. An interesting fact about me is that as a child I had an original Macintosh that my uncle gave to me on my birthday.<br></br>
                <em>Also I think space is pretty neat.</em> </p>

                <h1> Why I.T? </h1>
								<p> My interest in I.T started last year when I made revolutionary YouTube videos about the monthly Mario kart tournaments that I have with friends. The fun started when I <em>legally</em> downloaded apps such as Photoshop, Premier pro and After effects, I really enjoyed playing around, experimenting and creating content with those apps. So what does this have to do with I.T? good question, while using these apps are fun and rewarding in their own way, I believe to develop and better understand what I’m doing and how I’m able to do it with a degree in I.T will give me a deeper understanding and help better my content in the future.</p>

								<h2>Why RMIT?</h2>
								<p>Me and RMIT go way back, back to 2013 in fact, as a doey eyed teenager fresh out of high school I was unprepared for the amount of work an engineering degree would have and that I shouldn’t have chosen this degree simply because I was GoOd aT mATh. So my main reason for joining RMIT a second time is to not repeat the same mistake as the first time, do a degree I have a vested interest in and prove to myself that I am capable of achieving a degree in higher education.</p>
								<h2>What i want to learn at RMIT</h2>
								<p>What I want with this degree is to fundamentally learn why I can do the things I do on a computer/phone and use that to create more content. You’ve used content twice but what do you mean by it? Another good question; Like IT, the content is very broad and can mean a number of things and that’s, I want to develop apps, create games make videos, learn to code. I believe the benefit of doing an I.T degree is that you can study many different areas of I.T and eventually refine that knowledge into a career of my choice and continue in some aspects of I.T as an interesting hobby. <br></br> <a href="#work"><strong>Ideal Job</strong></a>  </p>

								</p>

							  <h2>The position:</h2>
								<p>The position of gameplay programmer at naughty dog is has many responsibilities in which you will work hand in hand with the artists to develop new ideas and gameplay mechanics into the game. The core gameplay mechanics that you will work on are centred around the character and how they interact with the environment around them. There’s always room for creative expression in talking with design and writing teams and implementing your ideas (if good) in a forward and progressive work environment. </p>
								<h2>Skills Required</h2>
								<p>The skills required for the job are pretty loose; they do expect you to have a bachelor’s degree in computer science or equivalent work experience in that field however it’s not all they look for in an employee. They want someone who is passionate about games, someone who takes their free time to learn about the current techniques used by programmers in the industry through personal projects or making games. If you have console programming experience and strong math skills that will make you more employable but at the end of the day if you create your own content and are eager to contribute to all aspects of game development they will look positively on you.</p>
                <h2>Skills I Currently Have</h2>
								<p>At my previous place of employment I drove a forklift, so if they ever need a lead forklift gameplay designer I’m currently their man. On a serious note I have a desire to make content and think I can actively contribute to gameplay development not just in the programming side of things which is highly sought after. </p>
								<h2>How do I plan to obtain the skills necessary?</h2>
								<p>I believe that making your own content and being an individual will help you stand out in this field. a strong emphasis is placed on programming with all aspects of the C language which is a requirement for any job in the industry so starting to learn and get comfortable with those programming languages is a must, the sooner the better. For my free time or a personal project will be to make a game with the Unity engine. Unity uses C# and is recommend for a beginner so getting started with a game project soon is also a must and slowly build and adapt these skills when I know the tooling and how I can manipulate it in an engine.</p>

							  <h2>What do these results mean for me?</h2>
								<p>The results of these tests indicate that im a little bit shy but internally have a very creative personality. I prefer to stand back and observe for the most part, collect and analyze information before coming to any conclusion . I like to take sufficient breaks or in other words <em> multiple smokos </em> to reflect on the information given. The results of these tests are pretty accurate I agree that I can fit in this neatly packaged box of ideas most of the time. But on any other day I can be a leader or an extrovert depending on how im feeling, I used to be a team leader at my last job which contradics some aspects of the online tests. Overall though the tests do provide some insight to what im like most of the time, but not all the time.</p>

                <br></br>
								<h2>How do these results influence my behaviour in a team?</h2>
								<p>This indicates that in a team environment I like to have paired discussions with group members, I’m very agreeable and like to be coached. I would say based off the results that I would work well in a group with a strong leader, where I look at information given to me reflect on it and bring it up in discussion, form a plan and execute.</p>

								<br></br>
								<h2>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h2>
								<p>When forming a team the results of these tests paint people with a broad stroke. While the Myers-Briggs test does provide valuable insight into a persons’ characteristics, It’s not a formula to describe how that person interacts and adapts in a team environment. If a group is lacking a leader someone with minimal leadership traits can adapt and take the reins of a group if required.</p>

						<!-- Project Chicken run (working title)-->
							<article id="Project">
								<h2 class="major">Project: Chicken Run</h2>
                <h3><u>Overview:</u></h3>
								<p>This project will be to make a simple third person ‘platforming/deathmatch’ game with approximately five different tutorial levels with each one introducing a new key mechanic that proposes a gameplay challenge for the user and coding challenge for the designers. With an overall goal of making a multiplayer death match game mode. This will hopefully provide a game that’s fun for the user and have a high skill ceiling while also being an interesting programming challenge. </p>
								<h3><u>Motivation:</u></h3>
								<p>I believe making a game will be a really challenging but rewarding I.T project. The reason for introducing a new mechanic each tutorial level allows us to experiment with different aspects of the game i.e (platforming, gun mechanics, movement) and has the added benefit of being a structured programming challenge. This in turn can allow for us to “follow the fun” (The Games That Designed Themselves, 1:00) in which we can design a better game and explore a fun mechanic that sticks. This will be our first game; we’re not going to be able to make GTA V but will be a good introduction to game design and game programming. The best way to get anywhere in the industry is to “just make stuff”. (How to Become a Game Designer 3:40)</p>
								<h3><u>Description:</u></h3>
								<h4><strong>TUTORIAL:</strong></h4>
								<p>TUTORIAL: the tutorial levels will start out easy and get progressively harder. They will have clear start and end goal with helpful hints and game tips popping up in the UI. The game mechanics that they will introduce are centred around player movement and gunplay. If time permits there will be an enemy AI to defeat at the end of each level so the player has a chance to learn a little about the combat system before jumping into the deathmatch mode. </p>
								<h4><strong>Deathmatch:</strong></h4>
								<p>Deathmatch: The deathmatch mode will consist of 1 map and 2-8 chickens, with the usual rules of the victor being the one with the most kills at the end of the round. How those chickens get those kills will be either a peck mechanic (unarmed), melee weapon, environment death i.e lava or a projectile kill with a variety of guns and a rocket launcher. The guns will spawn randomly and periodically on specific platforms to give the user a dynamic fighting experience.     </p>
								<h4><strong>Gameplay:</strong></h4>
								<p>Gameplay: The real meat of the game and the core gameplay mechanic that should be focused on to make the game unique are the projectile mechanics. Chickens are not the largest of animals so if they shoot a gun or get shot there should be some consequence or weight behind it. If a chicken shoots a shotgun it should send you flying in the opposite direction. The cool thing about this is that it provides another movement option the player can use to reposition themselves to give them a competitive advantage. The environment should be treacherous with lava pits/ spike traps but also allow for dynamic movement with gravity pads/ grapple hooks locations for an interesting map. A glide mechanic can also be easily implemented to add more dynamic movement; after all they are flightless birds.</p>
								<h4><strong>Camera:</strong></h4>
								<p>A third person camera system can be set up using the ‘Cinemachine’ asset in unity. Traditionally it’s very difficult to set up a third person camera system. The outcome of this is that we get a much more responsive camera and flexibility to get the shots we want. Additionally we can add an aim/zoom mechanic with the “create virtual camera function” in the asset. </p>
